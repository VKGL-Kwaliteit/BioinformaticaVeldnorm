# Laboratory patients, user, and personnel feedback

Feedback to bioinformaticians can include different items:

- New feature requests (improvement suggestions by personnel). NOTE!!! most of these never reach the registration of the laboratory, we need to adress this somehow. This could be as labour intensive as 'counting and reporting' or making a note, that our work is per definition innovative and always includes improvements, hence, not taken along with ...
- Bugs. NOTE these probably never end up on the 'nonconfirming list' of the lab, what to do here?
- add more

A procedure should be documented about how feedback can be send to the bioinformatics team; i.e. email, ticketing system, meetings etc.
Most Bioinformaticians work with a ticketing system to prioritise their work items.
In general, the medical laboratory has a system in place to handle feedback and non conforming work. The bioinformaticians will use that system. However, once it comes to development of code, it is allowed to follow the ticketing system of the bioinformatics team. Make sure that there is a link between the issue of the bioinformics team and the id (?) of the laboratory.
